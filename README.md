A computer vision method for Field Emission Microscopy:  
It counts and computes the area of spots created by an electron beam projected onto a scintillator screen. This area is an important metric for characterizing emission uniformity on a cathode surface. While the targeted application is Field Emission Microscopy, the method can be applied to any images consisting of spot-like objects and a background, such as counting stars and calculating solid angle from telescope images.

Watch FEPIC_tutorial.mp4 to learn how to use the method. The code file is FEPIC_v01.m. To experiment with the code, use example images in excercise_images folder.  A paper explaining the method is published here: [https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaelm.1c00789](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaelm.1c00789)
